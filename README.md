Deploy obfs4 public Tor bridges to Openstack infrastructure. Many defaults of this module's
variables are specific to OVH, but left configurable to be able to be used on other Openstack
providers.

## Usage


**IMPORTANT:** We do not pin modules to versions in our examples because of the
difficulty of keeping the versions in the documentation in sync with the latest released versions.
We highly recommend that in your code you pin the version to the exact version you are
using so that your infrastructure remains stable, and update versions in a
systematic way so that they do not catch you by surprise.

Also, because of a bug in the Terraform registry ([hashicorp/terraform#21417](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/21417)),
the registry shows many of our inputs as required when in fact they are optional.
The table below correctly indicates which inputs are required.


## Example: OVH

```hcl
provider "openstack" {
  auth_url    = "https://auth.cloud.ovh.net/v3/"
  domain_name = "Default" # Domain name - Always at 'default' for OVHcloud
  user_name = "<horizon username>"
  password = "<horizon password>"
  tenant_id = "<find in your openrc.sh downloaded from horizon>"
}

locals {
  ssh_public_key  = "~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub"
  ssh_private_key = "~/.ssh/id_rsa"
}

module "bridge" {
  source          = "sr2c/tor-bridge/openstack"
  # TODO: version         = "x.x.x"
  count           = 1  # increase for more bridges
  namespace       = "<yourorg>"
  name            = "bridge"
  attributes      = [tostring(count.index)]
  region          = "UK1"
  ssh_public_key  = local.ssh_public_key
  ssh_private_key = local.ssh_private_key
  contact_info    = "<admin email address>"
}
```

## Example: GandiCloud VPS

```hcl
provider "openstack" {
  auth_url    = "https://keystone.sd6.api.gandi.net:5000/v3"
  domain_name = "public" # Always at 'public' for GandiCloud VPS
  region      = "FR-SD6" # This is the only region available at time of writing
  user_name   = "<Gandi v5 username>"
  password    = "<Gandi v5 password>"
  tenant_name = "<Gandi organisation name>"
}

locals {
  ssh_public_key  = "~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub"
  ssh_private_key = "~/.ssh/id_rsa"
}

module "bridge" {
  source          = "sr2c/tor-bridge/openstack"
  # TODO: version         = "x.x.x"
  count           = 1 # increase for more bridges
  namespace       = "<yourorg>"
  name            = "bridge"
  attributes      = [tostring(count.index)]
  region          = ""
  ssh_public_key  = local.ssh_public_key
  ssh_private_key = local.ssh_private_key
  contact_info    = "<admin email address>"

  image_name                    = "Debian 11 Bullseye"  # GandiCloud VPS specific value
  flavor_name                   = "V-R1"                # GandiCloud VPS specific value
  external_network_name         = "public"              # GandiCloud VPS specific value
  require_block_device_creation = true                  # GandiCloud VPS specific value
}

## Trans Rights

![Trans Rights Are Human Rights][trans_rights]

Trans is an umbrella term to describe people whose gender is not the same as, or does not sit comfortably with, the
sex they were assigned at birth. *Like all people*, they have the right to be treated with dignity and respect and to
have their human rights protected.

Transgender people face significant discrimination and prejudice in many areas of their lives, including employment,
education, housing, and healthcare. They are also at increased risk of violence and hate crimes. These issues
can have a serious impact on the physical and mental well-being of transgender people and can prevent them from fully
participating in society.

Transgender rights are therefore an important part of the broader struggle for human rights. Everyone, regardless of
their gender identity, should be able to live their lives free from discrimination and to enjoy the same rights and
opportunities as everyone else. This includes the right to express their gender identity and to be treated with respect
and dignity.

It is important for society to recognize and respect the rights of transgender people, and to take steps to address the
discrimination and prejudice that they face. This can include supporting policies and laws that protect transgender
people from discrimination and promoting acceptance and understanding of transgender people within the broader
community.

* [Gendered Intelligence](https://genderedintelligence.co.uk/) is a trans-led and trans-involving grassroots organisation
  with a wealth of lived experience, community connections of many kinds, and a depth and breadth of trans community
  knowledge. They offer staff training, consultancy, youth work, mentoring and undertake public engagement activities.

* [TransAid Cymru](https://transaid.cymru/) began life as a local mutual aid group in Cardiff. Tired of the ways that the
  electoral political system had let the trans community down, they decided it was time to do something for themselves.
  Many of the founding members were disabled and unemployed. Familiar with the real, material needs of the trans
  community and how little support there was out there, they founded the mutual aid group in order to provide the services
  the trans community needed.

(or both) of the above groups.
